# About me

I'm a Statistician interested in using *data analysis* and *data visualization* to build great things. I am passionate about using technology and data science to solve people/employees' problems, and this directly reflect on my work around People Analytics.
I love storytelling and teaching new concepts to other people, this is the main reason for the [blog](https://gustavopantiga.github.io/post)

When I'm not dealing with data-related topics, I enjoy doing all sorts of phisical activities: ranging from yoga to powerlifting.
